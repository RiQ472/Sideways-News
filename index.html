    <h3>It's confirmed you are not getting sleep today</h3>
        <p>Granted it is yolur fault for not asking questions sooner but at the same time this has helped you learn something rather important. You actually do enjoy the process of figuring this out on your own</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't do this again</li>
            <li>We appreciate sleep and for all the braincells it gives back in the process</li>
            <li>The news is bad but it isn't too bad</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My definition of Sideways news:</p>
        <p>Things could've turned out for the better but the did not turn out for the worst. The complex version of saying maybe with information niether good or bad.
            Ex. 
                My job hasn't fired me even though i've missed 3 of my shifts.
                the news is grand for this person but if you include both that persons opinion to another bystanders you will recieve a simple. "not exactly a good idea to skip work like that but at least you still have a job "
